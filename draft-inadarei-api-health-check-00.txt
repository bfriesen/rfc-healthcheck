1.  Introduction

   The vast majority of modern APIs, that drive data to web and mobile
   applications use HTTP [RFC7230] as a transport protocol.  The health
   and uptime of these APIs determine availability of the applications
   themselves.  In distributed systems built with a number of APIs,
   understanding the health status of the APIs and making corresponding
   decisions, for failover or circuit-breaking, are essential for
   providing highly available solutions.

   There exists a wide variety of operational software that relies on
   the ability to read health check response of APIs.  There is
   currently no standard for the health check output response, however,
   so most applications either rely on the basic level of information
   included in HTTP status codes [RFC7231] or use task-specific formats.

   Usage of task-specific or application-specific rformats creates
   significant challenges, disallowing any meaningful interoprerability
   across different implementations and between different tooling.

   Standardizing a format for health checks can provide any of a number
   of benefits, including:

   o  Flexible deployment - since operational tooling and API clients
      can rely on rich, uniform format, they can be safely combined and
      substituted as needed.

   o  Evolvability - new APIs, conforming to the standard, can safely be
      introduced in any environment and ecosystem that also conforms to
      the same standard, without costly coordination and testing
      requirements.

   This document defines a "health check" format using the JSON format
   [RFC7159] for APIs to use as a standard point for the health
   information they offer.  Having a well-defined format for this
   purpose promotes good practice and tooling.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  API Health Response

   An API Health Response Format (or, interchangeably, "health check
   response") uses the format described in [RFC7159] and has the media
   type "application/vnd.health+json".

   *Note: this media type is not final, and will change before final
   publication.*

   Its content consists of a single mandatory root field and several
   optional fields:

   o  status: (required) indicates whether the service status is
      acceptable or not.  API publishers SHOULD use following values for
      the field:

      *  "pass": healthy,

      *  "fail": unhealthy, and

      *  "warn": healthy, with some concerns.

Internet-Draft Health Check Response Format for HTTP APIs   January 2018


      For "pass" and "warn" statuses HTTP response code in the 2xx - 3xx
      range MUST be used. for "fail" status HTTP response code in the
      4xx - 5xx range MUST be used.

      In case of "warn" status, additional information SHOULD be
      provided, utilizing optional fields of the response.

   o  version: (optional) public version of the service.

   o  release_id: (optional) in well-designed APIs, backwards-compatible
      changes in the service should not update a version number.  APIs
      usually change their version number as infrequently as possible,
      to preserve stable interface.  However implementation of an API
      may change much more frequently, which leads to the importance of
      having separate "release number" or "release_id" that is different
      from the public version of the API.

   o  serviceID: (optional) unique identifier of the service, in the
      application scope.

   o  description: (optional) human-friendly description of the service.

   o  memory: (optional) array of sizes for the currently utilized
      resident memory (in kilobytes) on each of the logical nodes
      backing the service.  Logical node can be a physical server, VM, a
      container or any other logical unit that makes sense for service
      publisher.

   o  cpu: (optional) array of cpu utiliation percentage on each of the
      logical nodes backing the service.  Logical node can be a physical
      server, VM, a container or any other logical unit that makes sense
      for service publisher.

   o  uptime: (optional) current uptime in seconds since the last
      restart

   o  connections: (optional) current number of active connections

   o  notes: (optional) array of notes relevant to current state of
      health

   o  output: (optional) raw error output, in case of "fail" or "warn"
      states.  This field SHOULD be omitted for "pass" state.

   o  details: (optional) an array of objects optionally providing
      additional information regarding the various sub-components of the
      service.

   o  links: (optional) an array of objects containing link relations
      and URIs [RFC3986] for external links that MAY contain more
      information about the health of the endpoint.  Per web-linking
      standards [RFC5988] a link relationship SHOULD either be a common/
      registered one or be indicated as a URI, to avoid name clashes.

3.  Security Considerations

   Clients need to exercise care when reporting health information.
   Malicious actors could use this information for orchestrating
   attacks.  In some cases the health check endpoints may need to be
   authenticated and institute role-based access control.

4.  IANA Considerations

   Thanks to Mike Amundsen, Erik Wilde, Justin Bachorik and Randall
   Randall for their suggestions and feedback.  And to Mark Nottingham
   for blueprint for authoring RFCs easily.

Appendix B.  Creating and Serving Health Responses

   When making an health check endpoint available, there are a few
   things to keep in mind:

   o  A health response endpoint is best located at a memorable and
      commonly-used URI, such as "health" because it will help self-
      discoverability by clients.

   o  Health check responses can be personalized.  For example, you
      could advertise different URIs, and/or different kinds of link
      relations, to afford different clients access to additional health
      check information.

   o  Health check responses must be assigned a freshness lifetime
      (e.g., "Cache-Control: max-age=3600") so that clients can
      determine how long they could cache them, to avoid overly frequent
      fetching and unintended DDOS-ing of the service.

   o  Custom link relation types, as well as the URIs for variables,
      should lead to documentation for those constructs.

Internet-Draft Health Check Response Format for HTTP APIs   January 2018


Appendix C.  Consuming Health Check Responses

   Clients might use health check responses in a variety of ways.

   Note that the health check response is a "living" document; links
   from the health check response MUST NOT be assumed to be valid beyond
   the freshness lifetime of the health check response, as per HTTP's
   caching model [RFC7234].

   As a result, clients ought to cache the health check response (as per
   [RFC7234]), to avoid fetching it before every interaction (which
   would otherwise be required).

   Likewise, a client encountering a 404 (Not Found) on a link is
   encouraged obtain a fresh copy of the health check response, to
   assure that it is up-to-date.
